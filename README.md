# Project 2: Dive Log

## Description:
A Node/Express/MongoDB, full-stack app designed for divers to log and access their dives online. 

## Technical Requirements
1. Have at least two data entities (data resources) in addition to the User Model
2. Use OAUth authentication
3. Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work
4. Have a full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.
5. Have a consistent and polished user interface
6. Be deployed online (Heroku)

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* EJS
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* GitHub Branching

## Getting Started

* [Link to app]("https://enigmatic-basin-31771.herokuapp.com/")

* Instructions: login with a google account to get started

## IceBox

* It would be great to add some more fields to the dive log. Was it in fresh water or salt water? Altitude? Etc.
* Create another schema to hold dive buddies would allow user to select a buddy from a dropdown menu. This would save some typing time if the user is always diving with the same few people. The same would be true for dive sites.
* Using a third-party-API, allow users to connect with one-another and have the option to view each others dive logs.

## Project Hurdles
* The largest hurdle I had, by far, was having to start my project over two days before it was due. My first plan was to create a flashcard app, but after creating all of the CRUD functionality I was left with the question of how to implement the "previous card", "next card", and "flip card" functions. While it was possible to create routes for this functionality to work, I quickly realized that the combination of technologies required for this project were not the most efficient tools for a flash-card app. It would be like squashing a square peg into a round hole. This project was designed to give us a thorough understanding of the required technologies - not just _how_ to use them, but also _when_ to use them. I chose to honor the purpose of the project by choosing a new app that would be better suited to the technology - thus, the dive log app was born. Despite doubling my work load, I am glad of my choice because I now feel extremeley confident in my ability to the involved technologies.
